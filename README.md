## China

There are hundreds of ebike companies operating in China, given the massive size of the market. Here are some key details:

* According to estimates, there are over 1,000 manufacturers of ebikes and ebike components in China.  
* Most are concentrated in manufacturing hubs like Guangdong province, Zhejiang province, Jiangsu province and Shandong province.
* The majority of companies are small to medium sized operations producing ebikes, conversion kits, batteries, motors and other components.
* It's estimated there are roughly 50-100 large scale ebike makers that account for the majority of market share.
* The top 10 ebike companies in China control around half the total market. These include giants like Yadea, Aima, Xiaomi and Jiangsu Xinri E-Vehicle.
* Other major players include Bafang, Tailg, Mingjia, Qianxi Vehicle and Incalcu. Bafang is the leader in motors.
* Foreign brands have struggled to gain much market share against the slew of domestic competitors.
* In recent years there has been some consolidation among the many small ebike makers in China.
